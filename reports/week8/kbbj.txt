CSE 403 - Individual Status Report

Section 1 - Last Week:
Last week I set up the CI/CD platform with Travis CI and created a deployment 
pipeline for running the app on Heroku. I also improved the build process and 
the setup of the dev environment running on a local computer.

Section 2 - Current Week:
I finished the continuous deployment pipeline and reached a running version in the cloud. I added a test framework and implemented a test suite for the code we had so far. 

Section 3: Next Week
Next week we will should have a working version of our project. I'll be verifying that things are working in the production server and add integration tests to the codebase.
