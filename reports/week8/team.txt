Last Week
We will also have the implementation in place to try end to end tests of simple messages with mock data
We will continue to add more citations and conduct experiment (if prototype available) to our report where
necessary to support the claims and assumptions we made
We will have a clear interaction spec among different modules within our system. For example, when a certain
command is sent by user, what endpoint in the event-handler module should the Slack module call, and what method
in the Github module should the event-handler invoke to process that request.

This Week
We found some publications that support our claim. 
We are still In the process of coming up surveys and experiments. 
We now have a clear contract of interaction between slack bot and event handler.
We finished most parts of the implementations of event handler and some parts of the slack bot. 
We configured CI/CD pipeline, and reached a running version in the cloud. We added a test framework
and implemented a test suite for the code we had so far. 


Next Week
Next week we should have a working version of our project, in order to reach the goal we will
need to come up with a contract between event handler and GitHub module and finish implementing the event handler and slackbot.
We will also add integration tests to the codebase.
