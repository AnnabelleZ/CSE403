CSE 403
Individual Status Report #5
Annabelle Zha

Section 1 - Last Week:
I shoud definitely start actually coding and add more features to our bot next week. 
For the team I hope we can continue to add more citations to our report to support
the claims and assumptions we made, also we should come up with a better user study plan.

Section 2 - Current Week:
I discussed with the member who is in charge of the event handler about implement
specifications (ie. how our code should interact). I also wrote some implementations
for our slack bot.

Section 3: Next Week
For the incoming week I need to finish the implementation and testing of my part.
