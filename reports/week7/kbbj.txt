Section 1 - Last Week:
Last week I prepared and presented slides of our project up to this
point. I created the skeleton of our REST server that will accept and 
process incoming messages from Slack and GitHub

Section 2 - Current Week:
I began coding the interaction between messages in slack and GitHub
and planned out the implementation of the CI/CD pipeline we will use
to deploy our production webserver.

Section 3 - Next Week:
I will continue to evaluate the different components of our project,
create a working test suite that will be automatically triggered
by github commits prior to deploying on Heroku. We will also have
the implementation in place to try end to end tests of simple 
messages with mock data
