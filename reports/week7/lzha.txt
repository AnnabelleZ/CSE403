CSE 403
Individual Status Report #4
Annabelle Zha

Section 1 - Last Week:
I still think it's urgent to implement our experiment to prove the benefits
our project can bring. For the incoming week I hope I can finish my Javascript
entry level online course.  I plan to add more features to our bot so that
it can have simple conversations with us in our Slack workplace. 

Section 2 - Current Week:
As I mentioned last week I had trouble understand code written by my teammates
due to unfamilarity to the framework we are using. To catch up, I watched a couple of
tutorials on Node JS, Json, Javascript, and building RESTful apis with Node & Express.
I participated in the presentation last week and I added a few paragraphs&citation and
made a few modifications to our report.

Section 3: Next Week
I shoud definitely start actually coding and add more features to our bot next week. 
For the team I hope we can continue to add more citations to our report to support
the claims and assumptions we made, also we should come up with a better user study plan.
