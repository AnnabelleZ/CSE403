Last Week Summary
We plan to implement the functionality of the slack bot (UI) and send data to GitHub through the API. Besides, we hope to be parsing data from the Slack Events API when the QReview commands are invoked. We will also look into whether it is possible for our github bot to post a comment on behalf of a user.

Current Week Progress
This week we began to configure the Slack Bot and able to send test result invoked by test command in our local development.
For the Slack Event API, we now have a list of event cases and wrote some starter routing code for it.
We did some preliminary research and think Github bot is able to post comments on behalf of users and we are in the stage
of configuring and implementing it. 
We also shifted our architecture as we now think a separate server is needed to power our app. 
Based on the feedback, we gathered specific evidence from published papers and researches to support out claim and
prove the project is novel and worth developing.
We also added a CI/CD pipeline and a test suite for future development

Next Week Plan
1. We will also have the implementation in place to try end to end tests of simple messages with mock data
2. We will continue to add more citations and conduct experiment (if prototype available) to our report where
necessary to support the claims and assumptions we made
3. We will have a clear interaction spec among different modules within our system. For example, 
when a certain command is sent by user, what endpoint in the event-handler module should the Slack module call, 
and what method in the Github module should the event-handler invoke to process that request.
