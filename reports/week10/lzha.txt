CSE 403
Individual Status Report #6
Annabelle Zha

Section 1 - Last Week:
Created a survey and spread it to my friends for gaining some user study result. Did some pair programming
as a group to get the slackbot working without errors. Spent much time on trying to get the project run on my laptop (windows).

Section 2 - Current Week:
I will complete my part once the github and databse is set up completely. I'm currently helping
to come up with a specific plan for the comparative user study and we should be conducting it
before the deadline of the final report. Will continue to gather more user data and add it to
our report.

Section 3: Next Week
Finish implementation, and distribute the app.
