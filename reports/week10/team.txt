Last Week
Last week we spent some time doing pair programming for our implementations.
However, we were not able to publish the app as planned. 
Instead, we chose to invite interested users into
our workspace and let them try out Qreview there as this requires minimal setup.
We also created a survey for qualitative research and gained some prliminary results.

This Week 
we conducted a comperative study of the efficiency of our app.
The initial results showed proof that our app can indeed improve code review
efficiency by reducing communication friction.

Next Week
Next week we hope to see our app finally published in the 
Slack App Directory :)
