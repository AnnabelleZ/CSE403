CSE 403
Individual Status Report #1
Annabelle Zha

Section 1 - Last Week:
My personal goal for the week is to get myself familiar to the basic
syntax of Javascript as many parts of this project require knowing Javascript. 
As for the team, I think our first goal for next week is to implement the
experiment we mentioned in proj2 proposal to prove that our project does
improve productivity for collaborative code review. Another goal is to figure
out a set of command languages that allow our users interact with our
API directly from Slack. Finally I hope we can all get a very clear sense
of the details of our architecture and start coding for our API next week. 

Section 2 - Current Week:
As I was assigned to build the bot of our API, I created a new Slack app
this week, added some basic features including a bot user and configured
some basic permission options. Through these implementations I gained some
familiarities to the Slack bot toolkit.
I also started learning Javascript grammar on a study app.
As for the team, we created a set of command languages and did a mockup of our
user interface. We had a meeting on Thursday this week where we went
over the proj3 feedback.

Section 3: Next Week
I still think it's urgent to implement our experiment to prove the benefits
our project can bring. For the incoming week I hope I can finish my Javascript
entry level online course. I plan to add more features to our bot so that
it can have simple conversations with us in our Slack workplace.
