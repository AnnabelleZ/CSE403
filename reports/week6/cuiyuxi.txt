CSE 403
Individual Status Report #2
Yuxi Cui

Last Week Summary
In the following week, I hope our group will have a clear idea of the project architecture and a user interface. 
Also, I think we need to come up with a set of command languages for our project. 
After having these done, it would be great if we can actually start the implementation on the code for the APIs, web servers, authentications, etc. 
Last but not least, I think we should divide the work better such that everyone has a part he is responsible for and we can review each othersâ€™ parts before the final submission.

Current Week Progress
I helped in revising and inspecting the architecture.
I participated in creating the command language, especially how to represent the line number in the changed code.
I started to look into the Slack API and webhooks. I put down some initial thoughts on webhooks receiving and routing handling.


Next Week Plan
1. Have a first draft of event handler sub-architecture
2. Start developing the event handler
3. Figure out the core logic for text processor.
