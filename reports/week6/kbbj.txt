Section 1 - Week Recap
==========================
We finished the architectural design of the application.
We also created a mock up of the user interface we plan to implement.

Section 2 - Week Progress
==========================
This week we began to configure the application that will live
in Slack. We also began to implement the API layer that will 
interact with the GitHub API.

Section 3 - Next Week Tasks
==========================
Next week we plan to implement the functionality of the slack bot (UI)
and send data to GitHub through the API. Finally we hope to be parsing
data from the Slack Events API when the QReview commands are invoked.
