CSE 403
Individual Status Report #6
Annabelle Zha

Section 1 - Last Week:
For the incoming week I need to finish the implementation and testing of my part.

Section 2 - Current Week:
This week my focus is still on coding. I went over the first version of my code with my teammates
and received some feedback. After that I have done some major modifications to slackbot.js. 
My implementation is mostly done now but haven't written unit tests for them yet. Some parts are
potentially buggy. 

Section 3: Next Week
Next week my goal is to gather data for our user study, finish testing of my part, and distribute the app.
