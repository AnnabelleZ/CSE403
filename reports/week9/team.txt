Last Week
We found some publications that support our claim and
presented our project to the class. 
We finished most parts of the implementations of event handler and some parts of the slack bot. 
We configured CI/CD pipeline, and reached a running version in the cloud. We added a test framework
and implemented a test suite for the code we had so far.

This Week 
This week, in addition to the presentation of the project 
to the class and the draft of our final report, we focused
on the implementation of our project to get it to a working
state. We finally implemented module to communicate with
GitHub as well as a database to store relevant data and
began manually testing the project. Our initial
results identified bugs and further development needs but 
we ended yesterday with a working version from github pull
request creation to comments on the pr. We also sent out a
survey and began to receive feedback from real users on the
concepts of code reviews in general and our app. 

Next Week
Next week we will get the app in front of users for a round
of concentrated feedback on the current features of the 
applications and attempt to address the concerns of our 
users. Next week we hope to see our app published in the 
Slack App Directory :)

Meeting Agenda
1. Final draft feedback
2. Devise a user testing plan 
3. Gather advice, suggestions, and address concerns
