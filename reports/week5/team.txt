No data to report from last week

Section 2 - Week Progress
==========================
This week we began to outline the architecture and implementation
of our application. We also started to define the features we 
deemed were part of the Minimum Viable Product. In the meeting
Last week, we were able to take notes on feedback from the final
project proposal and discuss the changes we planned to make in
the next iteration. We finished our first draft of the architecture design. Also, we had a prototype for our user interface and we came up with a set of commands. In terms of project development, we havenâ€™t done any actual coding but we started to look at tutorials and example projects to get a understanding of the system. Last but not least, we assigned specific responsibility to each individual team member.

Section 3 - Next Week Tasks

For next week, we hope to have begun implementation on the web
server needed to run this application (All). We will also set 
up OAuth tokens needed for GitHub and Slack APIs (Keegan). In addition, we will try to implement the experiment we mentioned in proj2 proposal that proves our project does improve productivity for collaborative code review (All).
