Section 1 - Week Recap
==========================
No data to report from last week

Section 2 - Week Progress
==========================
This week we began to outline the architecture and implementation
of our application. We also started to define the features we 
deemed were part of the Minimum Viable Product. In the meeting
last, week we were able to take notes on feedback from the final
project proposal and discuss the changes we planned to make in
the next iteration. 

Section 3 - Next Week Tasks
==========================
For next week, we hope to have begun implementation on the web
server needed to run this application (All). We will also set 
up OAuth tokens needed for GitHub and Slack APIs (Keegan). 
Finally, we will have defined the user interface and the 
communication strategy of the application with the user 
(Annabelle & Ethan).
